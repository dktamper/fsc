Why do you think understanding computer programs is relevant in our time today especially in the new normal?\n    * Since so much of our world is automated, computer programming is important today. The relationship between people and computers must be able to influence humans. We use computer programming to harness the computational power, because computers and machoines are able to do things so easily and accurately. In this time of new normal, I think the relevant of understanding computer program is that it helps us to train our brain to break every problem down to bits and understand it better. You start seeing issues in the light of solutions when study computer programs. After learning computer programs, when experiencing problem, you start envisionining potential ways to solve it. You could also predict any positive outcomes from it. However complicated the issue seem you are determined to act on it regardless. You turn yourself into an entity guided by the solition.\n    \n2. If you were be able to learn computer program what program will you code? Why?\n    * If i were be able to learn computer program, the program i will code is the artificial intelligence. Arteficial Intelligence is a class of computer programs that \"learns\" to matvh mathematical data models, meaning it attempts to fit. This is distinct category of software since its funcionality is not fully human-designed, but evolves on its own.\n    \n3. What would be your primary motivation in learning programming?\n      \n      * As a beginner, my primary motivation in learning programming is choosing consistency over speed. I know learning programming isn't easy but little by little I will be a good coder as I learn. On the same note, the rather cliched saying, \"slow and steady wins the race\" is very true. This is why consistency is more important than trying to go as fast as I possibly can. "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Application\n\n### Ask yourself:\n   1. Why do you think Python is the most applicable programming language for scientific computing?\n       \n       * I think Python is the most applicable programming language for scientific computing because it is great for prototyping (e.i. dynamic typing), flexible interaction with other languages, and manipulates string surprisingly well - natural language processing, artificial intellegence and big data, etc.\n       \n   2. If Python\tcan\tbuild anything,\twhere do you think Python is not applicable?\n   \n       * One of Python's drawbacks is that it is not native to the mobile environment. Neither of the major mobile platforms - iOS and Android - support Python as an official programming language. One reason for that is the memory consumption. For any memory intensive tasks Python is not a good choice. That is why it is not used for that purpose."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Exercise 1: Mailing Address"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def personal_details():\n    name, age = \"Dan Kevin Amper\", 20\n    address = \" Purok 7, Bago Gallera, Davao City\"\n    print(\"Name: {}\\nAge: {}\\nAddress: {}\".format(name, age, address))\n\npersonal_details()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Exercise 2: Area of a Room"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"width = float(input(\"please enter the height:\"))\nlength = float(input(\"please enter the length:\"))\narea = width*length ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Exercise 3: Arithmetic"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import math\n\na = int(input(\"Enter first number: \"))\nb = int(input(\"Enter second number: \"))\n\n#Calculating and printing sum\nprint(a,\"+\",b,\"=\",a+b)\n\n#Calculating and printing difference\nprint(a,\"-\",b,\"=\",a-b)\n\n#Calculating and printing Quotient\nprint(a,\"/\",b,\"=\",a/b)\n\n#Calculating and printing product\nprint(a,\"*\",b,\"=\",a*b)\n\n#Calculating and printing remainder\nprint(a,\"%\",b,\"=\",a%b)\n\n#Calculating and printing log10 a\nprint (\"math.log10(a) : \", math.log10(a))\n\n#Calculating and printing log10ab\nprint (\"math.log10(ab) : \", math.log10(a)+ math.log10(b))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Exercise 4: Area and Volume"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from math import pi\nr = float(input (\"Input the radius of the circle : \"))\nprint (\"The area of the circle with radius \" + str(r) + \" is: \" + str(pi * r**2))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.11","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2}
